### **Guide to Module 5: Dynamic Flow**

#### **Core Concept**

Module 5 provides the crucial bridge from the static, equilibrium-based laws of Part I to the dynamic evolution of systems in time. It addresses the fundamental question: "Given a system's target equilibrium state, how does it get there over time?" The module posits that the rate of change of a system's output is directly proportional to the difference between its current state and its target equilibrium state. This introduces a canonical and universal model for relaxation dynamics.

#### **The Canonical Equation of Relaxation**

The module states that the temporal evolution of a system's output, $y(t)$, towards its target equilibrium state, $R(x)$, is governed by a first-order non-homogeneous linear differential equation.

The equation is:
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = k(R(x) - y)$$

Where:
* $y(t)$ is the system's actual output at a given time $t$.
* $R(x)$ is the target equilibrium response function for a given stimulus $x$, as defined by the static modules of Part I.
* $k$ is the rate constant of the system, representing its intrinsic agility or speed of response (units of $T^{-1}$).
* $\tau = 1/k$ is the system's characteristic **relaxation time**.

#### **Derivation of the Response to a Step Stimulus**

A common and important scenario is to analyze a system's response when a constant stimulus, $x$, is applied at time $t=0$ and held constant. In this case, the target $R(x)$ is a constant value. The module provides a step-by-step derivation for the exact trajectory of $y(t)$.

**1. Rearrange the ODE**

The equation is first put into the standard form for a linear first-order ODE: $\frac{dy}{dt} + P(t)y = Q(t)$.

$$\frac{dy}{dt} + ky = kR(x)$$

**2. Define the Integrating Factor**

The integrating factor, $\mu(t)$, is calculated as $e^{\int P(t)dt}$.

$$\mu(t) = e^{\int kdt} = e^{kt}$$

**3. Multiply Through by the Integrating Factor**

Every term in the rearranged ODE is multiplied by $\mu(t)$.

$$e^{kt}\frac{dy}{dt} + ke^{kt}y = kR(x)e^{kt}$$

**4. Apply the Product Rule in Reverse**

The left side of the equation is now the exact derivative of the product $y(t)\mu(t)$.

$$\frac{d}{dt}(y(t)e^{kt}) = kR(x)e^{kt}$$

**5. Integrate Both Sides**

We integrate both sides from an initial time $t=0$ (with initial condition $y(0)=y_0$) to a final time $t$.

$$\int_{0}^{t}\frac{d}{dt'}(y(t')e^{kt'})dt' = \int_{0}^{t}kR(x)e^{kt'}dt'$$$$[y(t')e^{kt'}]_{0}^{t} = kR(x)[\frac{1}{k}e^{kt'}]_{0}^{t}$$$$y(t)e^{kt} - y_0e^{0} = R(x)(e^{kt}-e^{0})$$
$$y(t)e^{kt} - y_0 = R(x)(e^{kt}-1)$$

**6. Solve for y(t)**

Finally, we isolate $y(t)$ by multiplying the entire equation by $e^{-kt}$.

$$y(t) = (R(x)(e^{kt}-1))e^{-kt} + y_0e^{-kt}$$
$$y(t) = R(x)(1-e^{-kt}) + y_0e^{-kt}$$

This solution can be rearranged to clearly show the structure as a final state plus a decaying transient term related to the initial conditions.

$$y(t) = R(x) + (y_0-R(x))e^{-kt}$$

#### **Conclusion for Module 5**

Module 5 provides the formal bridge from the static framework of Part I to time-domain dynamics. It establishes a canonical law for how systems approach equilibrium. The derived solution demonstrates that any system governed by this module will exponentially approach its target equilibrium state $R(x)$ with a characteristic time constant $\tau=1/k$. This module introduces the fundamental process of "becoming" to the architecture, allowing it to model not just what a system *is* at equilibrium, but how it gets there.
